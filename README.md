# Hackpad-macropad
A small macropad based off of Blueprint Hackclub's hackpad guide. It has 2x EC11 rotary encoders, 14x switches, and an oled screen. based off the XIAO rp2040 DIP

My macropad is almost completed, I just need to add a few final touches, but I wanted to make sure I submitted it before the deadline, and make the final edits ASAP. 

Currently: PCB - Done
Schematic - Done
Case top - Done
Case Bottom - Only need to brand/add name
Firmware - halfway

Just wanted to make sure i got it in in time. :)
